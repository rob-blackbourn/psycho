# Buyers Remorse

There was a downside to this. You needed to install the specific build tool, in
order to build and develop the project.

This was a barrier to entry. You find an interesting package; clone it, setup
your virtual environment, and then; oh. It uses a build system I don't have.
Shall I bother to find out how to get it set up, or just move on?
